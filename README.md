# Ezri
Ezri is an IRC client written in 2010 to act as an IRC services daemon. The project is now abandoned, but this code has been made available for viewing as part of a portfolio.

I haven't done much with this code in several years, and as such cannot provide any measure of support. Please do not attempt to rely on this project for anything, as I cannot guarantee functionality.
